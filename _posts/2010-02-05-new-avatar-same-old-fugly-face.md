title: New Avatar, Same Old Fugly Face
categories: [personal]
---

Today marks the day I update my online avatar/profile picture. I've had the same sepia colored half-face avatar for 4 or 5 years now. So it was about time for a change. However, the biggest reason I changed it, was cause I cut my hair short in November, after having long hair for about 10 years.

But why the heck am I blogging about it? Cause I wanted to have an excuse to add [Fancybox][] to my newly redesigned site. And the previous post was looking lonely after two days in solitary here.

So without further ado, I present my old and my new avatar in complete Fancybox glory with fading animations and all. If you're reading this in a feed reader, click <a href="http://jimeh.me/blog{{ page.url }}">here</a> (if you're really bored).

Because I'm a perfectionist and decent bit insane, here's the 50x50 pixel versions too, so you can see how they both look in really small sizes, which is the most common size they appear in on different sites anyway.

And incase you're wondering, I'm 18 or 19 in the old photo, and 24 in the new one. If I shave though I can easily fool people into believing that I'm 17. In fact, some people think I am 17 :P... I guess I'll appreciate it more when I'm 30-40 and people think I'm 26, hehe.
