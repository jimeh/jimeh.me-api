Here I am, on a small little island in the middle of nowhere, a 9 hour ferry trip from Athens. There are no ferries for another 24 hours, and I've got an eye exam in 12 hours, which I've waited for the past two months.

I was supposed to travel back to Athens this afternoon, but yesterday morning the communist party in Greece initiated a ferry strike, stopping all ferries in and out of Piraeus as far as I've understood. And only for two days, the second day being the one I was supposed to travel on.

To top it off, I was calling the hospital repeatedly this morning for about 3 hours to try to reschedule my appointment, and all I got was either a busy tone, or no answer at all, on all their phone numbers. If I ever do get hold of anyone there, I'll probably need to wait six months this time instead of two considering how my luck is going.

As I was writing the previous paragraph my sister called me, with news of a rumor that there's no ferries scheduled to the island till June. Not so sure I believe it, but I doubt it'd surprise me that much at this point... lol

FML :D
