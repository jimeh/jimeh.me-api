So I finally bit off my own sense of perfection in regards to my Zynapse web-development framework for PHP5 which I started developing in 2007. It was never perfect, never ready, so I never released.

Now after close to two years of hardly working on it, and doing most things with Ruby on Rails, I've decided to push it up on GitHub as is.

So check out [Zynapse](http://github.com/jimeh/zynapse) on GitHub if you're interested.
